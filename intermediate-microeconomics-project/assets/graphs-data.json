    "full_html": "<h3>A. Cost/Benefit axis</h3>\n  <p>\n    The first panel compares total benefit <em>B(h)</em> and total cost <em>C(h)</em>. \n    The vertical distance between the two curves is net benefit. \n    At \\\\(h = 3.5\\\\)\\\\), this gap is largest, so it is our candidate optimal choice.\n  </p>\n  \n  <h3>B. Marginal Benefit / Marginal Cost axis</h3>\n  <p>\n    The second panel shows marginal benefit \\\\(MB(h) = \\\\frac{dB(h)}{dh}\\\\) and marginal cost \\\\(MC(h) = \\\\frac{C(h)}{dh}\\\\). \n    MB(h) and MC(h) are derivatives of B(h) and C(h) (Graph A).\n    The optimal choice occurs where \\\\(MB = MC\\\\), the benefit of spending another hour is the same as the cost of it. \n    Which happens at <em>h = 3.5</em>.\n  </p>\n  \n  <h3>C. Net Benefit axis</h3>\n  <p>\n    The third panel plots net benefit \\\\(NB(h)\\\\) maps out the gap between B(h) and C(h) in graph A. \n    The best choice is where this curve reaches its maximum. \n    At that point the slope of net benefit is zero, so \n    \\\\(NB(h) = \\\\frac{dNB(h)}{dh} = 0\\\\) at \\\\(h = 3.5\\\\).\n  </p>\n  \n  <h3>D. Marginal Net Benefit axis</h3>\n  <p>\n    The last panel shows marginal net benefit, which is the derivative of NB (Graph C.) \n    \\\\(NB(h) = MB − MC\\\\). \n    The optimum is where this curve crosses zero. \n    At \\\\(h = 3.5\\\\), marginal net benefit equals zero, which is equivalent to \n    choosing the point where marginal benefit equals marginal cost and net benefit is maximized.\n  </p>"
