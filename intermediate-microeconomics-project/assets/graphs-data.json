Marginal Benefit / Marginal Cost axis</h3>\n  <p>\n    The second panel shows marginal benefit \\(MB(h) = \\frac{dB(h)}{dh}\\) and marginal cost \\(MC(h) = \\frac{C(h)}{dh}\\). \n    MB(h) and MC(h) are derivatives of B(h) and C(h) (Graph A).\n    The optimal choice occurs where \\(MB = MC\\), the benefit of spending another hour is the same as the cost of it. \n    Which happens at <em>h = 3.5</em>.\n  </p>\n  \n  <h3>C. Net Benefit axis</h3>\n  <p>\n    The third panel plots net benefit \\(NB(h)\\) maps out the gap between B(h) and C(h) in graph A. \n    The best choice is where this curve reaches its maximum. \n    At that point the slope of net benefit is zero, so \n    \\(NB(h) = \\frac{dNB(h)}{dh} = 0\\) at \\(h = 3.5\\).\n  </p>\n  \n  <h3>D.
